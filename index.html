      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an actor who found joy in the art of coding.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Fife, Washington.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Sci-fi and fantasy writing, guitar, singing, cooking, clay sculpting, cosplay, video games, ya know, nerd stuff.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I have several. I'm not sure what my dream coding job is, but I enjoy it enough to say I'd like just about any in the field.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>North Hollywood, California</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>In the midst of the COVID crisis my current skillset of restaurant worker/actor/filmmaker doesn't exactly pay the bills. I have all the time in the world to learn to code, and much to my surprise, I find it quite fun and relaxing. It's a series of logic puzzles and attention to detail, and for some reason it just tickles my brain. But in short, ya boy needs money. </p>
